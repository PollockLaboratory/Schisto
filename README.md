Scripts used for calculating rare allele sharing and preliminary related clusters

The rare allele sharing script produces output for findSibClusters.pl.

Note: findSibClusters.pl does not actually identify sibling clusters; it does identify clusters of individuals who share proportions of alleles greater than a user-modifiable threshold. Actual realtionships between individuals should be determined by posterior probabilities of different relationship types.
